# Personal HTML and CSS Practice Repository

This repository is my personal workspace for practising HTML and CSS.

## Description

I use this repository to work on personal projects, experiment with code, and showcase my skills in web development. It's not intended for general use or as a tutorial for others. Feel free to explore the code and projects to get an idea of my coding style and capabilities.
